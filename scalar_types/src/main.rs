    Scalar types are types that represent a single value.
In rust, scalar types are:
    1. Integer: These are numbers without fraction components
    2. Floating point: Numbers with fraction components
    3. Boolean: true or false
    4. Characters: letters and emojis
Scalar types are immutable by default
